	<h1>Birds are nesting on our porch!</h1>
	<p>Near the end of June, we saw two birds scouting out our porch, one with a twig in its mouth. We saw it lay down the twig, and the next day we had a nest on our porch!</p>
	<p>After research, the two birds are house finches. The one with red is the male, and the grey one is the female.
	<h1>The eggs!</h1>
	<img src="5eggs.png" alt="Five eggs in the nest!">
	<p>Now, at the time this picture was taken (7/6), I just thought there was a weird egg. But yesterday (7/17), I was researching, and I found out the weird-looking egg is actually a cowbird egg.</p>
	<p>Cowbirds are very interesting. Cowbirds are parisitic birds, and they will lay their eggs in the nest of other birds, and expect that bird to raise their egg. If the mother cowbird notices the bird is not raising their egg, the cowbird will go into the other birds nest when they are out, and murder their babies.</p>
	
	<p>More coming soon...</p>
